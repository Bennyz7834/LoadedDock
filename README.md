# LoadedDock

---

LoadedDock is a library extension to [**DockyardMC**](https://github.com/DockyardMC) with the main purpose to add additional coding features to make things easier, some inspired from [**DiamondFire**](https://mcdiamondfire.com/about/).

*Note: As DockyardMC is still being developed, things will be prone to be removed or changed in the future!*
